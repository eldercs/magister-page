      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <h2>Personal development</h2>
      <p>
        I, Druchevsky Denis was born on October 18, 1999 in the city of Donetsk,
        I grew up in a family of engineers. Parents: Druchevskaya Albina
        Zufarovna and Druchevsky Vitaly Viktorovich, I also have a younger

        classes, where I was taught to count and write.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 12, 2007 went to Donetsk comprehensive school №102, study was
        easy and without unnecessary difficulties. Throughout my favorite
        subjects were history and literature. I loved participate in sports
        competitions from the school. loved to draw and music. Somewhere around
        then I started to get involved in swimming and participate in small

        trying new things. Also briefly visited basketball, volleyball and
        combat sambo sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family played a big role in my development. Thanks to my uncle I am
        very got acquainted with the computer early. My parents often bought me
        educational toys such as constructors, puzzles, coloring books, board
        games. AT In 2007 they bought me my first computer on which I mainly
        played only in computer games. Also, as a family, we often went to
        different trips to the sea or to the forest to the country. Because of
        what since childhood I have left a large number of vivid memories with
        friends and parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last class, I decided to connect my life with programming,
        because that he believed that the profession had great potential in the
        modern world, because of which he passed the exam in mathematics, very
        successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of university fell on DonNTU due to the fact that I took
        additional courses in mathematics in it and this university provided a
        huge choice various fields of specialization in programming. The
        specialty of software engineering was taken because of training in it
        programming languages that I did not know at the time of admission. FROM
        with good grades at school, I managed to enter the budget for
        specialties. I did not stop at the successful admission. Right away I
        began to master new programs and technologies. I was incapable Get
        started with programming labs right away. like many other students.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my first year of study, I had to deal with many difficulties in
        mastering technologies unknown to me, but thanks to perseverance and
        cunning, it was possible to pass the sessions. On the last In the
        course, I chose a naughty leader, Olga Valentinovna Rychka. The topic of
        my first thesis: "Online hotel booking". Me a web application with a
        connected database was implemented and laid out on free hosting. After
        passing which I received a diploma bachelor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, after graduating from a bachelor's degree, I decided to enroll
        in a master's program because I was interested in technologies for
        training neural networks and I wanted to get a master's degree.
      </p>
      <h2>Professional development</h2>
      <p>
        I began to think about the choice of the future profession in the 8th
        grade. Initially, I planned to connect my life with such sciences as
        biology and history. In 10th grade, I rethought my decision and decided
        become an engineer, like my parents. I saw in this recruiting popularity
        directional great potential in the future and also I loved work with a
        computer and wanted to learn more about the secrets of this technology
        because of which I decided to join.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my studies, I studied many different technologies and worked with
        many programming languages. I tried to make applications in C++, C# and
        Java, drawing in Photoshop, creating neural networks in Python, doing
        applications for mobile devices in Android Studio and studied working
        with SQL databases using C# and PHP, but I liked the most web
        development because of my love for design and drawing. Also more than
        once had the opportunity to participate in group projects and work on
        various interesting projects. During my studies, I had the opportunity
        to work trainee at two enterprises and get acquainted with their
        structure. After studying specialties, I decided to further develop in
        the field of front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment I am already working in the field of web development on a
        beginner position and improve my skills. I create pages with using Vue 3
        and sometimes modifying the frontend part in PHP.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals, plans and vision for the future</h2>
      <p>
        The main plan for the future is the defense of a master's thesis,
        graduation university, employment in Russia for the specialty frontend a
        developer who will be close to home and become good at it specialist.
        Among personal goals, I would like to highlight the improvement of
        skills English, especially spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
